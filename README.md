# Project Overview
This project was carried out in order to produce insight to a call center company; to determine how much calls come to the company, the response of the calls and the satisfaction of their clients to the calls.

# Power Query
the columng 'Resolved' renamed to 'resolution' and anywhere in that column 'Y' is replaced to resolved and 'N' replaced with unresolved.The column named 'Answered' renamed to 'Response' and 'Y' and 'N' replaced to 'Answered' and 'unanswered'. The time was split from the date column into a new one. The datatype for the average time duration was changed to just time datatype. 

# PowerBi
The data was then launched into PowerBi for analysis and visualization. New measures were used to give insights to: Total Calls, Unansered Calls, Resolved Calls, Answered calls and Date

# Analysis 
The following insights were gotten:
1. Total number of calls
2. Average Speed of Answer
3. Average Satisfaction Rating
4. Total Call by Response
5. Total Call by Resolution
6. Average of Speed on answer in seconds by Agent
7. Total call by month and response
8. Resolved calls and average of speed of answer in seconds by topic
